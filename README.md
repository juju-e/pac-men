## A short review
When i started working on this game, everything was easy peasy before i started making the ghosts, some undefined behaviours were observed when i was making the enemy class, if i completely  fail in making the AI behind the ghosts i decided that i will make the game a 2 players deathmatch game, as of now i'm using Breath first search and it's working in knowing the easyiest path between the ghost and pac-man but i keep failing in updating the ghost it=nto reaching pac-man, currentky the ghost just go pursuiing pac-man with an incredible speed i would like to dimunish
## How-to run

```
$ love .
```
